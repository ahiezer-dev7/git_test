Hi 
Tips, and habits for me, Small changes make a big difference

1- 1% better every day I will end up being 37 times better by the end of the year.

2- Do not focus on my goals but on the systems that will lead me to achieve it

3- Have perseverance and motivation (there will be days that I do not have them)

4- Design or create my mind for problem solving and logic

end.
